# Super Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption Programme

This program can encode and decode your text input using Caesar Cipher's encryption method.

## How it works
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

### What is shift number?
Let's think an example, if our shift number is 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.

### How to encode
You should type 'encode' when it asks. Then, set a shift number (don't forget it if you want to decode it).
It shows your outcome in the screen.

### How to decode
If you want to decode your text, you should type your encoded text and enter the correct shift number.

## Extra Features
In Caesar Cipher's encryption method it only encrypts the letters, but sometimes we want to encode symbols and numbers.
In Super Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption you can encode and decode them too.
By now you can encode and decode 28 most used symbols.

#### 28 Most Used Symbols
'#', '$', '%', '&', '/', " ' ", '(', ')', '*', '+', ',', '-', '.', ':', ';', "<", '>', '=', '?', '@', '[', ']', '_', '{', '}', "|", '!', '^'

#### Numbers
You can encode and decode numbers   
'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'
